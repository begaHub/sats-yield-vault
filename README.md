# Sats Yield Vault

Sats Yield Vault is a decentralized staking protocol built on Bitcoin L1 that enables users to lock BTC-backed assets and earn programmable yield through transparent smart contract logic.

## Overview

Sats Yield Vault is designed to provide secure, non-custodial staking infrastructure directly on Bitcoin Layer 1. Users deposit BTC-backed assets into a vault contract and earn yield based on programmable reward distribution logic.

## Core Principles

- Non-custodial architecture
- Transparent on-chain logic
- Deterministic reward distribution
- Bitcoin-native settlement

## Architecture (Planned)

- Smart contract vault
- Reward calculation engine
- Frontend dashboard
- Wallet integration
- Security audit layer

## Roadmap

Phase 1 – Contract Design  
Phase 2 – Reward Logic Implementation  
Phase 3 – Frontend UI  
Phase 4 – Testing & Security Review  

## Disclaimer

This project is experimental and under active development.
